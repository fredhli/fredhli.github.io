# **Sample Codes**
Welcome to my sample codes page! Here you'll find a collection of code snippets and projects that showcase my technical skills.

Feel free to explore and learn from these implementations. Each piece of code is documented to help you understand the underlying concepts and methodologies.

## **Sample Code 1**
### [Text-based Analysis of Novel Dataset](text-based-codes.md)
This Python script is a comprehensive text analysis tool designed for processing and analyzing a novel congressional hearing dataset. The code implements multiple natural language processing techniques for analyzing complex document structures and congressional discussions.

- **Text Analysis**: Advanced NLP techniques and document processing
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Emotion and opinion detection in congressional discussions
- **OCR Error Correction**: Automated text correction and enhancement
- **Speaker Identification**: Recognition and matching of committee members
- **Entity Recognition**: Using SpaCy and Hugging Face transformers
- **Document Parsing**: Complex structure analysis and text preprocessing

## **Sample Code 2**
### [TF-IDF Matching](tfidf-sample.md)
This Python script demonstrates text similarity matching using TF-IDF (*Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency*) vectorization and cosine similarity. The code implements efficient blocking and matching functions for comparing large sets of company names or similar text data.

- **Text Processing**: N-gram generation and tokenization
- **Similarity Calculation**: Optimized cosine similarity using sparse matrices
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Document feature extraction
- **Efficient Blocking**: Strategic data partitioning for large datasets


## **Sample Code 3**
### [Selenium-Notion PDF Scraper](notion-sample.md)

This Python script is a comprehensive automation toolkit that integrates with Notion API and web automation using Selenium. It includes utilities for PDF handling, text manipulation, and web scraping. Key features:

- **Notion API integration** for content management
- **Selenium web automation** with Chrome WebDriver
- **PDF generation** and manipulation
- **Text parsing** and formatting
- **Automated web content extraction**

<!-- ## **Sample Code 4**
### [Factor Analysis of ETFs Using Bayesian Statistics and MCMC Regression](mcmc.md)

In this individual practical project, I analyzed the decade-long performance of Vanguard ETFs using Bayesian methods and MCMC regression. The project aimed to evaluate CAPM, FF3, FF5, and FF6 models to identify the most effective model for factor-based pricing analysis. By employing the Chib and Zeng method, I selected predictive risk factors from six options, streamlining the analysis by focusing on essential factors. Additionally, I enhanced factor models with characteristics-based analysis to understand the impact of ETF characteristics on returns, comparing linear slope factors. The project involved managing complex datasets with R programming to ensure efficient data manipulation and preparation for comprehensive model analysis. -->
