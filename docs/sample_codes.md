# **Sample Codes**
Welcome to my sample codes page! Here you'll find a collection of code snippets and projects that showcase my technical skills.

Feel free to explore and learn from these implementations. Each piece of code is documented to help you understand the underlying concepts and methodologies.


## **Sample Code 1**
### [Text-based Analysis of Novel Dataset](sample_codes/cleanse_tb.md)
This Python script is a comprehensive text analysis tool designed for processing and analyzing a novel congressional hearing dataset. The code implements multiple natural language processing techniques for analyzing complex document structures and congressional discussions.

- **Text Analysis**: Advanced NLP techniques and document processing
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Emotion and opinion detection in congressional discussions
- **OCR Error Correction**: Automated text correction and enhancement
- **Speaker Identification**: Recognition and matching of committee members
- **Entity Recognition**: Using SpaCy and Hugging Face transformers
- **Document Parsing**: Complex structure analysis and text preprocessing

## **Sample Code 2**
### [TF-IDF Matching](sample_codes/tfidf.md)
This Python script demonstrates text similarity matching using TF-IDF (*Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency*) vectorization and cosine similarity. The code implements efficient blocking and matching functions for comparing large sets of company names or similar text data.

- **Text Processing**: N-gram generation and tokenization
- **Similarity Calculation**: Optimized cosine similarity using sparse matrices
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Document feature extraction
- **Efficient Blocking**: Strategic data partitioning for large datasets

## **Sample Code 3**
### [Selenium-Notion PDF Scraper](sample_codes/notion_selenium.md)

This Python script is a comprehensive automation toolkit that integrates with Notion API and web automation using Selenium. It includes utilities for PDF handling, text manipulation, and web scraping. Key features:

- **Notion API integration** for content management
- **Selenium web automation** with Chrome WebDriver
- **PDF generation** and manipulation
- **Text parsing** and formatting
- **Automated web content extraction**
