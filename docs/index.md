## About Me

![Headshot](assets/headshot_300px.png){align="right" style="margin-left: 50px"}

Welcome to my personal website! I am **Fred**, currently pursuing my Master's at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU). With a background in Economics and Finance from The University of Hong Kong (HKU), I specialize in data-driven financial analysis and quantitative research.

My expertise spans programming, machine learning, and traditional financial tools . With over three years of experience across trading, portfolio management, and research roles, I've managed portfolios up to $200 million and am recently contributing to research in macroeconomic policy analysis.

Feel free to explore my [Projects](projects.md), view my [Resume](cv.md), check my [Sample Codes](sample_codes.md), or learn more about my [Personal Life](personal.md) – including my introverted cat "小i" (Little-i)!
