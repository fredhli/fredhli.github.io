## About Me

<img src="/assets/headshot.png" alt="Headshot" style="width: 30%; border-radius: 8px; float: right; margin-left: 80px;">

Welcome to my personal website! I am **Fred**, a Quantitative Finance professional pursuing my Master's at **Washington University in St. Louis** (WashU). With a background in Economics and Finance from **The University of Hong Kong** (HKU), I specialize in data-driven financial analysis and quantitative research.

My expertise spans programming (Python, R, SQL), machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and traditional financial tools (Bloomberg, Capital IQ). With over three years of experience across trading, portfolio management, and research roles, I've managed portfolios up to $200 million and am recently contributing to research in macroeconomic policy analysis.

Feel free to explore my [Projects](projects.md), view my [Resume](cv.md), check my [Sample Codes](sample_codes.md), or learn more about my [Personal Life](personal.md) – including my introverted cat "小i" (Little-i)!
