# **Sample Code 4**

In this individual practical project, I analyzed the decade-long performance of Vanguard ETFs using Bayesian methods and MCMC regression. The project aimed to evaluate CAPM, FF3, FF5, and FF6 models to identify the most effective model for factor-based pricing analysis. By employing the Chib and Zeng method, I selected predictive risk factors from six options, streamlining the analysis by focusing on essential factors. Additionally, I enhanced factor models with characteristics-based analysis to understand the impact of ETF characteristics on returns, comparing linear slope factors. The project involved managing complex datasets with R programming to ensure efficient data manipulation and preparation for comprehensive model analysis.
